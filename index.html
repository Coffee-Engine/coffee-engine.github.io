            <p>Coffee Engine is a functional, 2D, and 3D game engine, originally created in house by <a href="https://obviousstudios.dev/">Obvious Studios</a>.
            Originally a simple web-creation tool now has expanded into a game engine.</p>

        <h2 class="coolText">Why?</h2>
        <div style="display: flex;">
            <p>
                Compared to coffee engine other engines are no where near as portable and flexible, typically being desktop
                only, or having limited web support. Inspired by Construct, Scratch, and Godot, Coffee Engine tries to be the best combination,
                of desktop and web based game engines.

                Coffee Engine was originally a framework for a game called Coffee Making Simulator+ thus it got its name,
                though as can be seen through the Engine's Mascot Tiramisu, it's distanced itself from the source a bit.
